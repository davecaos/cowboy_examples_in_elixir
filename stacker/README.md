# Stacker on the Web

This brings the [stacker sample app](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix/2.html) you built reading about building OTP apps using Mix to the web.  From a web page you can push more data or pop stuff off the stack.  The stack is shared between any one that connects to the server, so you can see what others have put on the stack.

I predict that once the world understands the multiplayer aspect this will be the game of the century.  No one will even remember Flappy Birds.
