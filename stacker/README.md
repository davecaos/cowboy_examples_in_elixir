# Stacker on the Web

This brings the [stacker sample app](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix/2.html) you built reading about building OTP apps using Mix to the web. Below you can either push a string on to the stack, or pop one off. The fun really starts when you open another browser and push stuff on there and pop it off here.
