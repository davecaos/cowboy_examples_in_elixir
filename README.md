# Cowboy Examples in Elixir

These are some examples of how to use [cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy) from [Elixir](https://github.com/extend/cowboy).

## Bidirection IO

These examples show off bidirectional IO in a browser.  SockJS is more well known, but bullet seems like a much simpler implementation.

* [Bullet Clock](./bullet_clock/) - use [bullet](https://github.com/extend/bullet) to show a clock. 
* [SockJS Echo](./sockjs_echo/) - use [sockjs-erlang](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-erlang) to echo back what's entered.  
* [Stacker on the Web](./stacker/) - use sockjs to give an interface to the [stacker sample app](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix/2.html).
