# Clock

A port of the [clock example
app](https://github.com/extend/bullet/tree/master/examples/clock].  It shows
off how to connect via Websockets, EventSource and long polling http.

To fetch the needed dependancies and run the server

    mix deps.get
    mix run --no-halt

Then open a web browser (all the way back to IE6!) to http://localhost:8080/
