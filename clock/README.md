# Clock

A port of the [clock example
app](https://github.com/extend/bullet/tree/master/examples/clock).  It shows
off how bullet can connect via Websockets, EventSource and long polling http
all at the same time.

To fetch the needed dependencies and run the server

    mix deps.get
    mix run --no-halt

Then open a web browser (all the way back to IE6!) to http://localhost:8080/
